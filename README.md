This is a project used for learning NestJS and Svelte.

The idea is to have an event portal application where users will be able to see, create, update and delete events
as well as be able to apply for an event. Through this application I will practice some of the basics of web development.

- Making a BE boilerplate
- Making a FE boilerplate
- Creating Authorization and Authentication logic
- Dockerizing BE, FE and creating a build and deploy pipeline
- Creating basic CRUD operations
